#   Queue Management Application
This project consists of designing and implementing a queue management application that assigns customers to queues. This problem is a practical problem that we find in our daily life. The main objective of a queue is to provide a place for a customer to wait before receiving a service. We can implement this application using two policies for distributing customers to queues: after the shortest queue, or after the shortest waiting time.
To use the application, the user has a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI).

Programming language: Java

The graphical user interface was developed using Java Swing.
